I intend to build a rainbow tables generator, which allows the user to have specified input. Generally, rainbow tables consist random characters (set by the user) and are usually found with string lengths of a maximum of nine characters. For some character sets, this could potentially take weeks to generate and use about a terabyte of space. However, if the user knows what an unhashed password looked like, they could create a much smaller table, in a shorter amount of time, with the potential to have string lengths many times larger than what could be done before. Example: The password length is 35 characters long. This password looks like this: "(2,1,2 | 2015-4-10 12:21:35)1a5rf2". This can be simplified to a specified list of coordinates, the date of the day, a list of times, and a list of six character strings
